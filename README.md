# Dr. Nicolás Abadía

## Bio

Nicolás Abadía received a Telecommunications Engineering degree from the Technical University of Madrid and the Royal Institute of Technology. Afterward, Nicolás obtained a joint M.Sc. in Photonics at Ghent University, the Royal Institute of Technology, and the Free University of Brussels. Dr. Abadía pursued his Ph.D. degree at the University of Paris-Sud, working in collaboration with CEA-Leti. Nicolás was a joint postdoctoral fellow at Trinity College Dublin and McGill University, working on III-V and silicon photonics devices and systems in partnership with Ciena, Lumentum, and Western Digital.
Dr. Abadía is currently an assistant professor at Cardiff University and the Institute for Compound Semiconductors with research interests including integrated photonic devices and systems in III-V, silicon, and silicon nitride platforms for aerospace and data/telecom.
Dr. Abadía has received several international recognitions, including the 2016 OSA Outstanding Reviewer Recognition, the SPIE Optics and Photonics Education Scholarship, and the Erasmus Mundus Scholarship; as well as national recognitions such as the Dr. César Milstein Grant and the best thesis award by the Official College of Telecommunication Engineers and the Spanish Association of Telecommunication Engineers.
